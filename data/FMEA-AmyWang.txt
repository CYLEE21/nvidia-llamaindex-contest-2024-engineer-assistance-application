1. Failure Mode: Water Pump Malfunction
Effect: No water is pumped, resulting in no coffee being brewed.
Cause: Blockage in the water line, pump motor failure.
Current Controls: Regular maintenance checks, inline water filters.
Recommended Actions: Implement a more robust filtration system, add a sensor to detect water flow issues early.

2. Failure Mode: Heating Element Failure
Effect: Water is not heated, leading to cold coffee.
Cause: Electrical failure, overheating.
Current Controls: Temperature sensors, thermal fuses.
Recommended Actions: Upgrade thermal fuse quality, add redundancy in heating elements.

3. Failure Mode: Grinder Jam
Effect: Coffee beans are not ground, halting coffee preparation.
Cause: Beans stuck in grinder, motor failure.
Current Controls: Manual grinder cleaning protocols, automatic shutoff if jam is detected.
Recommended Actions: Improve grinder design to prevent jams, introduce a self-cleaning feature.

4. Failure Mode: Control Panel Malfunction
Effect: User cannot select brewing options or start the machine.
Cause: Software glitch, physical damage to buttons or touch screen.
Current Controls: Firmware updates, durable materials for touch panels.
Recommended Actions: Enhance software testing, use more resistant materials for control panel.

5. Failure Mode: Milk Frother Failure
Effect: Milk is not frothed, affecting specialty coffee options.
Cause: Blockage in frother nozzle, motor failure.
Current Controls: Cleaning recommendations, motor overload protection.
Recommended Actions: Redesign frother to minimize blockages, implement a more reliable motor.
