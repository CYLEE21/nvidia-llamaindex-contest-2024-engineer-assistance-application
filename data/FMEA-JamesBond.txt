Product: Advanced Coffee Maker with Iced Coffee and Juice Capabilities Date: October 16, 2024 Prepared by: James Bond, Quality Engineer

1. Failure Mode: Ice Maker Malfunction

Effect 1: No ice production, unable to make iced coffee.

Effect 2: Souce water contaminated, the leakage of motor oil contaminate the water and lower.

Cause: Ice maker motor failure, blocked ice dispenser.

Current Controls: Routine motor checks, dispenser cleaning protocols.

Recommended Actions: Upgrade motor durability, add sensors to detect blockages early.

2. Failure Mode: Juice Extractor Jam

Effect 1: Unable to produce fresh juice.

Effect 2: Overheating of the motor, potential safety hazard.

Cause: Fruit pulp blockage, motor overload.

Current Controls: Manual cleaning of extractor, motor temperature monitoring.

Recommended Actions: Redesign extractor for easier cleaning, implement automatic shutoff for motor overload.

3. Failure Mode: Refrigeration Unit Failure

Effect: Inability to keep ingredients cool, affecting the quality of iced coffee and juice.

Cause 1: Compressor malfunction.

Cause 2: Refrigerant leakage.

Current Controls: Regular compressor maintenance, refrigerant level checks.

Recommended Actions: Improve compressor reliability, enhance leak detection systems.

4. Failure Mode: Juice Quality Degradation

Effect: Poor taste and texture of juice.

Cause 1: Contaminants in the juicer.

Cause 2: Improper storage of juice ingredients.

Current Controls: Cleaning guidelines, ingredient storage recommendations.

Recommended Actions: Use higher quality materials for juicer parts, improve storage compartment design.

5. Failure Mode: Temperature Control Malfunction for Iced Coffee

Effect: Incorrect temperature for iced coffee, either too warm or too cold.

Cause: Thermostat failure, sensor miscalibration.

Current Controls: Regular calibration checks, redundant temperature sensors.

Recommended Actions: Upgrade thermostat accuracy, implement advanced calibration methods.
