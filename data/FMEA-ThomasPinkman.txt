1. Failure Mode: Water Leakage

Effect 1: Water damage to internal electronic components.

Effect 2: Reduced water supply, affecting brewing quality.

Cause: Seal failure at the water reservoir, cracked water lines.

Current Controls: Regular seal inspections, pressure testing of water lines.

Recommended Actions: Use higher quality seals, reinforce water lines with protective casing.

2. Failure Mode: Temperature Sensor Malfunction

Effect 1: Overheating, causing potential burn hazards.

Effect 2: Underheating, resulting in lukewarm coffee.

Cause: Electrical short, sensor calibration drift.

Current Controls: Routine sensor calibration, circuit protection mechanisms.

Recommended Actions: Implement dual temperature sensors for redundancy, enhance sensor protection.

3. Failure Mode: Frother Motor Overload

Effect: Motor burnout, disabling milk frother function.

Cause 1: Frother nozzle blockage, causing increased motor strain.

Cause 2: Overuse without adequate cooling periods.

Current Controls: Motor temperature monitoring, user guidelines for frother use.

Recommended Actions: Improve motor cooling system, add automatic usage limitations.

4. Failure Mode: Power Supply Fluctuations

Effect 1: Inconsistent brewing performance.

Effect 2: Premature wear on electronic components.

Cause: Voltage spikes, unstable power input.

Current Controls: Surge protectors, power supply filters.

Recommended Actions: Integrate advanced voltage regulation, improve power supply design.

5. Failure Mode: Coffee Ground Contamination

Effect: Off-flavors in brewed coffee.

Cause 1: Foreign particles in grinder.

Cause 2: Mold growth due to improper cleaning.

Current Controls: Grinder cleaning recommendations, built-in cleaning cycle.

Recommended Actions: Use higher-grade materials to reduce contamination, enhance cleaning protocols.
